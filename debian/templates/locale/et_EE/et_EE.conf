#### Profile configuration

## Prepare kernel command line parameters by build-simple-cdd

# Override locale= and keyboard= defaults from base.conf only when you
# known what you are doing as new values might be incompatible with
# some consoles (e.g. serial supports only 'C' and 'en_US' for locale).

# debian-installer/locale={locale}
#locale='en_US'

# console-keymaps-at/keymap={keyboard}
# keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap={keyboard}
# keyboard-configuration/layout={keyboard}
#keyboard='us'
